<<--------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics_02 Project_01 Scene------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->>

# Project makes use of a bunch of models, textures and lighting. I've made use of FBO textures and 2nd Pass filters in the project.

## How to build - The solution "Graphics02Project01.sln" needs to be built(either in Debug or Release). The project "GraphicsScene" should be set as startup project. Now the project can be run. 

### Controls - There are camera controls for the user.
	 - 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 keys can be pressed for a bunch of different camera angles
	 - W,A,S,D,Q,E for camera movement
	 - Mouse movement for camera rotation
	 - Spacebar to pause and resume mouse mouvement(by default it is set to pause)
